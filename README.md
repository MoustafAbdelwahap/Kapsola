Data Labeling Approach

Project Overview and Goal

The problem is that doctors take much time and effort to 
identify cases of pneumonia in children because it depends 
on many factors.
I use ML for many reasons :
• it has the ability to extract patterns faster than 
humans so it can quickly help flag serious cases and 
identify healthy cases. 
• ML can reach more high accuracy than human eyes 
and this is important if the case was urgent .
• There is already a lack of doctors in the world so 
having some assist from technology will help the 
humanity.

Choice of Data Labels

I added three labels Normal case , Pneumonia case and 
Unknown case .
• It is easier for data annotators to categorize an image 
of three probabilities.
• It was necessary to add the uncertain choice -
Unknown case - since the data annotators are not 
specialized
